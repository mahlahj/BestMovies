# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
This also means you're, at least, familiarized with React.js.\
In case you don't, follow the above link and read some of the basic functions to develop a simple React App (you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) too). :smiley:

## Basics

You **NEED** to obtain a personal [The Movie Database key](https://www.themoviedb.org/) in order to function.\
This can be done by signing into the page, click into `profile` and then on `settings` from the topple-down menu.\
This will redirect you to a new page, with a large box on the left, scroll-down until you see `API` and click on it.\
Follow the on-screen instructions to generate your own personal key! :smiley:

\Also, you'll need to have installed **INSIDE** the project folder: [React router](https://reactrouter.com/), [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Prop-Types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types), [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/), either with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).\
We recommend to use VSCode as your default editor due to several extensions that make coding easier, but feel free to use any.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
