# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
This also means you're, at least, familiarized with React.js.\
In case you don't, follow the above link and read some of the basic functions to develop a simple React App (you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) too). :smiley:

## Basics

You **NEED** to obtain a personal [The Movie Database key](https://www.themoviedb.org/) in order to function.\
This can be done by signing into the page, click into `profile` and then on `settings` from the topple-down menu.\
This will redirect you to a new page, with a large box on the left, scroll-down until you see `API` and click on it.\
Follow the on-screen instructions to generate your own personal key to change in the environmental variable `REACT_APP_API_KEY`! :smiley:

Also, you'll need to have installed **INSIDE** the project folder: [React router](https://reactrouter.com/), [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Prop-Types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types), [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/), either with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).\
We recommend to use VSCode as your default editor due to several extensions that make coding easier, but feel free to use any other.

## How to's

First create a folder on your desktop (way easier to spot and find it for later modifications) with the name of the project, open the code editor of choice and the built-in (if available) console/terminal and run: `npx create-react-app <name of the app>`.\
This will take some time, but will create the basic scaffold for the app, then unzip the contents inside the new folder, or copy the contents of every folder inside this project.\

The work tree must look like this:

Once the folder and subfolders are created/copied in the project directory, make sure you are on the project folder and you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Also is opened in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to be viewed in the default browser.

The page will reload if you make edits (try to play with it).\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
